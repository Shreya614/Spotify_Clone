# Spotify_Clone
A music player interface inspired by Spotify using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes features like a navigation bar, playlist display, song control buttons, and a progress bar for seeking through songs. The player allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous song, and adjust the progress of the currently playing song.
