# Spotify_Clone
A music player interface inspired by Spotify using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes features like a navigation bar, playlist display, song control buttons, and a progress bar for seeking through songs. The player allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous song, and adjust the progress of the currently playing song. 

# Note
To ensure the correct functioning of the code, please add up to 10 songs to the "songs" folder located under the "extras" directory. You can simply copy and paste the existing song file and rename it accordingly. Make sure to add a total of 10 songs to the folder for optimal results.

# Key Highlights:
1. Implemented the HTML structure and layout for the music player interface.
2. Styled the player using CSS, including navigation bar, container, song items, progress bar, and control buttons.
3. Utilized JavaScript to handle song playback, progress tracking, and song selection functionality.
4. Integrated Font Awesome icons to enhance the user interface and provide intuitive controls.
5. Dynamically loaded song data and cover images from an array of songs using JavaScript.
6. Implemented play/pause functionality, previous/next song navigation, and song progress control using JavaScript event listeners and manipulation of the audio element.
7. Created a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
8. Improved user experience by displaying song information dynamically while a song is playing.
9. Used various CSS techniques, such as transitions and opacity changes, to enhance the visual feedback of user interactions.
10. This project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to create interactive and visually appealing web interfaces.

# How to run the application:
Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) to see the Spotify-like music player interface.

You can click on the play button next to each song item to play that particular song. The bottom part of the interface shows the currently playing song, and you can control playback using the previous, play/pause, and next buttons.
